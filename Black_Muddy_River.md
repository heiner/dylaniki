Words by Robert Hunter; music by Jerry Garcia  
As performed by Bob Dylan in Melbourne, Australia, Apr 6 1992  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

* * * * *

A truly remarkable example of Dylan's ability to get through a text that
he only has a faint recollection of, *and still giving the impression
that something meaningful is going on.* He gets the refrain fairly
right, and a line or two from the original lyrics flash by, but apart
from that there is no relation at all between what he sings and what
Hunter wrote (or, for that matter between what he sings and what makes
sense – in any language), but still, it's a very arresting performance
of a very charming tune.

For these reasons I will – for once – completely disregard what Dylan
sings, and use Hunter's lyrics for the tab. BTW, this was the last song
that Jerry Garcia sang.

             A            Bm               D  A
    When the last rose of summer pricks my finger
            A       Bm               D
    And the hot sun chills me to the bone
           A              Bm           D   A
    When I can't hear the song for the singer
          F#m           E             D
    And I can't tell my pillow from a stone

    E            A           D           A
    I will walk alone by the black muddy river
        F#m       E          D
    And sing me a song of my own
    E            A           D           A
    I will walk alone by the black muddy river
        F#m        E           D
    And dream me a dream of my own

    When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain
    And the stars start to splatter in the sky
    When the moon splits the southwest horizon
    With the scream of an eagle on the fly

    I will walk alone by the black muddy river
    And listen to the ripples as they moan
    I will walk alone by the black muddy river
    And sing me a song of my own

    Bm           E
     Black muddy river
    A          F#m
    Roll on forever
          E                A
    Don't care how deep or wide
    E                  A
    If you got another side
    D          C#m (or A/c#)
    Roll muddy river
    Bm(7)      A
    Roll muddy river
    D           E      A
    Black muddy  river roll

    When it seems like the night will last forever
    And there's nothing left to do but count the years
    When the strings of my heart start to sever
    And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears

    I will walk alone by the black muddy river
    And dream me a dream of my own
    I will walk alone by the black muddy river
    And sing me a song of my own
    And sing me a song of my own
