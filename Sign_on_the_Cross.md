Words and music Bob Dylan  
Recorded during the Basement sessions (summer 1967)  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Bob's at the piano, so it's a black key. Robbie plays some licks high up
on the neck, and he uses the following shapes:

Eb: x-x-13-12-11-11  
Ab: x-11-10-8-9-8  
Bb7: 6-8-8-7-9-6

Since the greatness of this song lies in Dylan's vocal and Garth's
organ, and you won't be able to reproduce that anyway :-), you might as
well put on a capo somewhere to get simpler chords, or drop all the b's
and play E, A and B.

           Eb
    Now, I try, oh so awf'ly strong
          Ab          Eb
    And I just try to be.
             Eb
    And now, oh it's [an isle]*)
             Bb7
    But it's free.
               Eb         (Eb7)
    Yes, but I know in my head
               Ab        Eb
    That we're all so misled,
                  Eb              Bb
    And it's that ol' sign on the cross
                 Eb
    That worries me.

    Now, when I was just a bawlin' lad,
    I saw what I wanted to be,
    And it's all for the sake
    Of that I should see.
    But I was lost on the land
    As I heard that front door slam,
    And that old sign on the cross
    worried me.

    Ab   Eb

                    Ab
    Well, it's that old sign on the cross,
                    Eb
    Well, it's that old key to the kingdom,
                    Ab
    Well, it's that old sign on the cross
                Bb
    Like you used to be.
              Eb        Eb7
    But, when I hold my head so high
         Ab                    Eb
    As I see my ol' friends go by,
             Eb                     Bb
    And it's still that sign on the cross
                 Eb    Ab    Eb
    That worries me.

    Well, it seems to be the sign on the cross. Ev'ry day,
          Ab
    ev'ry night, see the sign on the cross just layin' up
                  Eb
    on top of the hill. Yes, we thought it might have

    disappeared long ago, but I'm here to tell you, friends,
                   Bb
    that I'm afraid it's lyin' there still. Yes, just a
    Eb
    little time is all you need, you might say, but I don't
    Eb7                                                 Ab
    know 'bout that any more, because later on you might find

    the door, you might want to enter it, but, of course, the door might
       Eb
    be closed. And I just would like to tell you one time,
                                  Bb
    if I don't see you again, that the thing is, that the sign
                                       Ab                    Eb
    on the cross is the thing you might need the most.

             Ab
    Yes, the sign on the cross
              Eb
    Is just a sign [of cotton barkin' too]
                Ab
    Well, there is some in any prison
                 Bb
    And there is some in the penitentiary too.
                             Eb
    Oh, when your, when your days are numbered
    Eb7
    And your nights are long,
    Ab
     You might think you're weak
                                     Eb
    But I mean to say you're strong.

    Yes you are, if that sign on the cross,
    Bb
     If it begins to worry you.
                                    Eb           Ab
    Well, that's all right, you just sing a song
                                          Eb
    And all your troubles will pass right on through.
