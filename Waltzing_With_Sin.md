    C               G             F                C
    Some day you'll find that the world's left you out
       F             C                     G
    No true love, no nothing just roaming about
    C           G             F              C
    Parties and people, and a cold heart within
        F                C               G             C
    And each time you're dancing, you're waltzing with sin

           G                  C
    You're Satan made over in perfect disguise
      D7                      G
    Unfaithful, unworthy, and oh so unwise

      C        G            F            C
    I pity the heart Of the next guy you win
         F           C            G             C
    Like me he'll be losing while waltzing with sin
