    |: Bb   Eb/g Bb/f  Eb   Ab Eb    :|

        Cm
    You harbor resentment
                   Dm                   Cm        Bb
    You know there ain't too much of a thrill
        Cm
    You wish for contentment
                   Dm             Eb       Bb
    But you got an emptiness that can't be filled
           Cm                   Dm
    You've had enough of hatred
         Eb                                      F
    Your bones are breaking (and you) can't find nothing sacred, (but)

    Bb Eb/g Bb/f Eb  Ab Eb Bb    Eb/g Bb/f  [chords x2]
    Ye           shall  be changed,
    Bb Eb/g Bb/f Eb  Ab Eb Bb    Eb/g Bb/f  [x2]
    Ye           shall  be changed.
         F               Bb  F         Eb           Ab    Eb
    In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
        F          Bb   F         Eb          Ab    Eb
    The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
        Bb Eb/g Bb/f Eb  Ab Eb Bb    Eb/g Bb/f  [x2]
    And ye           shall  be changed

    Everything you've gotten
    You've gotten by sweat, blood and muscle
    From early in the morning 'til way past dark
    All you ever do is hustle
    All your loved ones have walked out the door
    You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more, but

    Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
    In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
    The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
    And ye shall be changed

    (Now) the past don't control you
    But the future's like a roulette wheel spinning
    (And) deep down inside
    You know you need a whole new beginning
    Don't have to go to Russia or Iran
    Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand, and

    Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
    In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
    The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
    And ye shall be changed

    You drink bitter water
    And you been eating the bread of sorrow
    You can't live for today
    When all you're ever thinking of is tomorrow
    The path you've endured has been rough
    And when you've decided that you've had enough, then

    Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
    In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
    The dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
    And ye shall be changed
