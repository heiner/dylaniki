        <h2>Introductory notes </h2>
        <h3>Eyolf &Oslash;strem</h3>
        <p>Ah, but what can I say&hellip;! This is the
        album that is responsible for my addiction to Dylan (and not
        because I bought it when it was released). It is not the one I play
        most regularly, but whenever I pick it out, I ask myself why I
        don&rsquo;t do it more often.</p>

        <p>Several of the songs are part
        of the daily routine, of course. Don&rsquo;t Think Twice, Masters
        of War, Hard Rain, Girl of the North Country, not to mention
        Blowin&rsquo; in the Wind &ndash; I do believe I hear at least one of
        these every day. Half an album of songs, almost 40 years old, by a
        then folk singer, that still hold their ground in the repertory of
        a man who has for 35 of those years been a rock artist &ndash;
        that&rsquo;s in itself a brand of quality.  And the rest of the
        songs ain&rsquo;t so bad either.</p>

        <p>What this album first of all shows (and which was confirmed by
        <em>Good As I Been To You</em>) is what an accomplished guitar
        player Dylan was &ndash; and still is, when he wants to. There is some
        really nice guitar work on some of these tracks: the finger-picking
        on <a href="dont_think_twice.htm">Don&rsquo;t Think Twice</a> and
        <a href="talkin_world_war_iii_blues.htm">Talkin&rsquo; WW3
            Blues</a>, the free-rhythmical blues a la Big Joe Williams of
        <a href="down_the_highway.htm">Down the Highway</a>, the lyricism
        of <a href="corrina_corrina.htm">Corrina Corrina</a>, and the
        persistent, rhythmical hammering-on of <a
            href="masters_of_war.htm">Masters of War</a>. None of it is
        really (really) difficult &ndash; he gets as much effect as possible from
        techniques that are actually quite simple (once you master them).
        This is not to say that he&rsquo;s a cheater (those who have access
        to  &ldquo;<a href="../00_misc/hero_blues.htm">Hero
            Blues</a>&rdquo;, an outtake from the
        <em>Freewheelin&rsquo;</em> sessions, can hear for themselves that
        Dylan anno 1963 had a quite good control of his instrument).</p>
        <p>A contributing element is the use of <a
            href="../roadmaps.htm">altered or open tunings.</a> Three of
        the songs on <em>Freewheelin&rsquo; </em>are in open D (<a
            href="i_shall_be_free.htm">I shall be Free</a>, <a
            href="corrina_corrina.htm">Corrina Corrina</a>, and <a
            href="oxford_town.htm">Oxford Town</a>) and three in Dropped D
        tuning (<a href="masters_of_war.htm">Masters of War</a>, <a
            href="down_the_highway.htm">Down the Highway</a>, and <a
            href="hard_rain.htm">Hard Rain</a>). Several of the outtakes
        also use such tunings. It is noteworthy that the playing style in
        these songs differs considerably from the style of the <a
            href="../16_bott/index.htm"><em>Blood on the Tracks</em></a>
        songs, which were also originally played in open D tuning. It is
        said that it was Joni Mitchell who inspired and/or taught him to
        use open D tuning, and although he apparently knew it even ten
        years earlier, he didn&rsquo;t use the same style and technique
        then.</p>

        <p>A striking unifying feature of the playing style of
        <em>Freewheelin&rsquo;</em> is the many second-inversion chords,
        <em>i.e.</em> chords with the fifth in the bass, such as D/a
        (x<strong>0</strong>0232), which is so prominent in <a
            href="blowin_in_the_wind.htm">Blowin&rsquo; In The Wind</a>.
        Another (I think related) feature is the many ways he uses to avoid
        the dominant, such as the turn C &ndash; Gadd4/b &ndash; G in <a
            href="blowin_in_the_wind.htm">Blowin&rsquo; in the Wind</a> and
        <a href="bob_dylans_dream.htm">Bob dylan&rsquo;s Dream</a>, about
        which I intend to write a little piece some day.</p> </div> </body>
