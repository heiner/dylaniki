    A

            A
    Well, I wake up in the morning

    There's frogs inside my socks

    Your mama, she's a-hidin'

    Inside the icebox
         D
    Your daddy walks in wearin'
                                   A
    A Napoleon Bonaparte mask
             E
    Then you ask why I don't live here
    D                           A
    Honey, do you have to ask?

    Well, I go to pet your monkey
    I get a face full of claws
    I ask who's in the fireplace
    And you tell me Santa Claus
    The milkman comes in
    He's wearing a derby hat
    Then you ask why I don't live here
    Honey, how come you have to ask me that?

    Well, I asked for something to eat
    I'm hungry as a hog
    So I get brown rice, seaweed
    And a dirty hot dog
    I've got a hole
    Where my stomach disappeared
    Then you ask why I don't live here
    Honey, I gotta think you're really weird.

    Your grandpa's cane
    It turns into a sword
    Your grandma prays to pictures
    That are pasted on a board
    Everything inside my pockets
    Your uncle steals
    Then you ask why I don't live here
    Honey, I can't believe that you're for real.

    Well, there's fist fights in the kitchen
    They're enough to make me cry
    The mailman comes in
    Even he's gotta take a side
    Even the butler
    He's got something to prove
    Then you ask why I don't live here
    Honey, how come you don't move?
