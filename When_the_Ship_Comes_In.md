           G              Bm'
    Oh the time will come up
             C/e        G
    When the winds will stop
            Em          C           G
    And the breeze will cease to be breathin'.
             G                Bm'
    Like the stillness in the wind
               C           G
    Before the hurricane begins,
        G             D          G
    The hour that the ship comes in.
            Bm'
    And the sea will split
            Am7       G
    And the ship will hit
            Bm'          Am7               G
    And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking.
             G         Bm'
    Then the tide will sound
            Am7       G
    And the waves will pound
            G       /b   /c   D /c /b-a G
    And the morning will be a-brea  -   king.

      morning will be a-break -  -  -  - ing

The fishes will laugh As they swim out of the path And the seagulls
they'll be smiling. And the rocks on the sand Will proudly stand, The
hour that the ship comes in. And the words that are used For to get the
ship confused

`    Em          C                G`

Will not be understood as they're spoken. For the chains of the sea Will
have busted in the night

`      G      /b     C      /b     D  /c /b-a G`

And be buried at the bottom of the o - cean.

    A song will lift
    As the mainsail shifts
    And the boat drifts on to the shoreline.
    And the sun will respect
    The every face on the deck,
    The hour that the ship comes in.
    Then the sands will roll
    Out a carpet of gold
             Em    C            G
    For your weary toes to be a-touchin'.
    And the ship's wise men
    Will remind you once again
             G      /b  C     /b D  /c /b-a G
    That the whole wide world is wa    -    tchin'.

    Oh the foes will rise
    With the sleep still in their eyes
    And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'.
    But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
    And they'll know that it's for real,
    The hour that the ship comes in.
    Then they'll raise their hands,
    Sayin' we'll meet all your demands,
    But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered.
    And like Pharaoh's tribe,
    They'll be drownded in the tide,
    And like Goliath, they'll be conquered.

Played on the piano, in basically the same way as the guitar version. I
had to tune the guitar up a little bit; he may have played it in Ab
major, since he likes the black keys on the piano.
