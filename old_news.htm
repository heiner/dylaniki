<h2>Chords added 2005 </h2>
<p><span class="date">May 9:</span> I told you, a change was gonna come, and here it is! &quot;Where?&quot; you might ask, and if you do, I'm glad, because the change is &ndash; or should be &ndash; below the visible surface. The only change you should be able to see is that the little picture to the right no longer says &quot;html 4.01&quot; but &quot;xhtml 1.0&quot;. Thanks to invaluable help from Heinrich K&uuml;ttler, the entire site (more or less) is now xhtml compliant, which may not make a big difference at the moment, but which gives some possibilities for the future.<br />
In the best of worlds, webmasters would wait until everything was changed and checked before a major update. This is not the best of worlds, and I'm not that kind of a webmaster. It became too confusing to have several different versions of the site lying around on the hard disk, on servers here and there, on USB sticks, and probably some more places, so I decided to put up the new version now. That means that there may be some missing files or links here and there, or some things that don't show up as they're supposed to. For such cases, I've made a copy of the &quot;old&quot; site available <a href="old/index.htm" target="_blank">here. </a>If you come across such problems, you may also send me an <a href="mail.htm">email</a> about it. </p>
<p>One change is more substantial: an introduction to <a href="11_newmorning/index.htm">New Morning</a>. </p>
<p><span class="date">April 25:</span> <a href="00_misc/a_change_is_gonna_come.htm">A Change Is Gonna Come</a> (28 March 2004, Apollo Theatre) </p>
<p><span class="date">April 24:</span> <a href="00_misc/lonesome_river_edge.htm">Lonesome River Edge</a> is a fragment performed on the Banjo Tape from Feb 8, 1963 </p>
<p><span class="date">April 19:</span> I've started an <a href="http://www.dylanchords.com/blog/index.php?cat=11">exploration</a> of the &ldquo;mathematical music&rdquo; theme from Dylan's <em>Chronicles</em> in the blog.<br />
  Oh, I almost forgot: I think there was a request for <a href="06_hwy61/desolation_row_solo.htm">the solo part of Desolation Row</a> :-) First three verses so far. </p>
<p><span class="date">March 21:</span> I have received a huge batch of corrections &mdash; small and big &mdash; from Heinrich K&uuml;ttler. This also gives me the opportunity to thank all of you who have contributed to this site in some way or another &mdash; through corrections, suggestions, tabs, comments, or financial support. I should have set up a list of benefactors from the start, but now it seems a little strange to start one, so here's a collective toast to you all. </p>
<p><span class="date">March 20:</span> One more from <em>Folksinger's Choice: </em><a href="00_misc/long_time_man.htm">Long Time Man</a> </p>
<p><span class="date">March 16:</span> Guthrie's <a href="00_misc/hard_travelin.htm">Hard Travelin'</a>, from Cynthia Gooding's <em>Folksinger's Choice </em>show (Jan/March 1962) </p>
<p><span class="date">March 3:</span> The Early Dylan Days continue with <a href="00_misc/1913_massacre.htm">1913 Massacre</a> (Carnegie Chapther Hall, Oct 4, 1961) </p>
<p><span class="date">March 2:</span> It's Early Bob Days at dylanchords. <a href="00_misc/two_trains.htm">Two Trains Running</a>, from the Finjan Club, Montreal, Jul 2, 1962 </p>
<p><span class="date">March 1:</span> Yet another almost-gem from the vaults of Cynthia Gooding: <a href="00_misc/roll_on_john.htm">Roll On John</a> from the <em>Folksinger's Choice</em> show, Jan/March 1962 ('almost' because of the howling, which becomes quite annoying after a while)</p>
<p>It was brought to my attention that the version of <a href="17_basement/dont_ya_tell_henry.htm">Don't Ya Tell Henry</a> differs quite a lot from what is on the official album. Truth to be told, I had forgotten that it wasn't Dylan singing on it, so I had only tabbed the outtake, and taken it for the release. Now there are two versions there instead. </p>
<p><span class="date">Feb 27:</span> <a href="00_misc/jesus_met_the_woman.htm">Jesus Met The Woman At The Well</a>, and Dylan sang about it, in Sid and Bob Gleason's home on a winter's day in 1961.<br />
  From the same tape comes The <a href="00_misc/trail_of_the_buffalo.htm">Trail of the Buffalo</a> </p>
<p><span class="date">Feb 24:</span> I wrote about <a href="01_bobdylan/in_my_time.htm">In My Time Of Dying</a> when I first made that tab: &quot;The song is basically just a finger-picking/bottleneck exercise over a sustained chord in open D/E tuning. It's all in the singing... :-)&quot;. Basically, it's true, especially the last sentence, but it wasn't very helpful, I know. Should be better now. </p>
<p>While I'm at it: Mike Daley's article about <a href="http://www.mikedaley.net/essay_vocalintonationbobdylan.htm">speech intonation in Like A Rolling Stone</a> was gone for a while, but I've located him again. </p>
<p><span class="date">Feb 21</span>: Finally! Now I can admit it: <a href="00_misc/wichita_blues.htm">Wichita Blues</a> has been bugging me for years. Thanks to a CD from Thomas Romon, and a file from lowgen at the Pool (heartfelt thanks to both!), I've finally won the struggle. Turned out it was played in a tuning he has never, to my knowledge, used anywhere else. The tab is from the Cynthia Gooding Tape (Feb/March 1962). There is some more about it in the <a href="blog/index.php">blog</a>. </p>
<p><span class="date">Feb 18</span>: From the third McKenzie Tape: <a href="01_bobdylan/see_that_my_grave_is_kept_clean.htm#mckenzie">See That My Grave Is Kept Clean</a> </p>
<p><span class="date">Feb 10</span>: The version of <a href="01_bobdylan/house_of_the_rising_sun.htm#1963">House of the Rising Sun</a> from the fourth McKenzie tape was requested, and it's a pretty good request. </p>
<p><span class="date">Feb 9:</span> Added the picking pattern of <a href="34_bootleg/hewasafriendofmine.htm">He Was A Friend of Mine</a>. </p>
<p><span class="date">Feb 3: </span>I have started my own <a href="blog/index.php" target="_blank">blog</a>&nbsp;&hellip; </p>
<p><span class="date">Jan 22:</span> This is probably not the most essential &quot;news&quot; report ever, but I just realized that the favicon (the site-specific icon that replaces the default <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=52534&amp;t=70">Firefox</a> icon in the address field and the bookmarks folder) (and don't tell me you're still using that thing with a blue &quot;e&quot;?!) was in a bad format, so that it may not have worked. If you want your bookmark to be graced by my beautiful icon, you may have to delete the current bookmark, possibly also clear the cache, and then add the bookmark again. That should work. </p>
<p><span class="date"> Jan 21</span>: The most requested update (together with the solo guitar part of Desolation Row) is the fingerpicking for <a href="01_bobdylan/baby_let_me_follow_you_down.htm">Baby Let Me Follow You Down</a>, which has now been updated.<br />
  I watched <em>Notting Hill</em> the other day, and as the subtitles rolled by, accompanied by Elvis Costello's beautiful rendition of <em><a href="others/costello_she.htm">She</a></em>, I realized that, being the sentimental sissy I am, I just had to tab it. </p>
<p><span class="date"> Jan 17:</span> Had a couple of days in Norway, and completed (finally!) my essay about Time out of mind, the blues, Einstein (no, not Einstein, really, just a hint of relativity and the curved space in the last paragraph), musical meaning, and <em><a href="professors/momentum.htm">The Momentum of Standstill</a></em>.</p>
<p><span class="date">Jan 10, 2005:</span> Happy New Year! The server was down yesterday, coinciding with the heavy storms in this area, but I'm neither blown away, nor drowned. <br />
  The <a href="chordszip.htm">zip file</a> has been updated - it was about time. </p>
<h2>Chords added 2004</h2>
<p><span class="date">Dec 26: </span>I've added a <a href="search.htm">search function</a> to the left menu. One of these days, I'm going to add some new tabs as well... :-) </p>
<p><span class="date">Dec 24:</span> The lyrics to <a href="10_selfportrait/days_of_49.htm">Days of '49</a> were not a reflection of what was sung. Now they are, thanks to UltimoDraq. The danes among you are probably the only ones who know Shit &amp; Chanel's <a href="others/smuk_og_dejlig.htm">Smuk og Dejlig</a>, a very accurate song, which is offered here as a tribute to my new life in my new country.<br />
  Oh yes, and: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p> <span class="date">Dec 23: </span> I've been fooling around with layout... I know &ndash; rollover buttons are <em>so </em>last week, but so am I... (and it's fun &ndash; look, no java!) It should work decently on all browsers and screen resolutions, but if you're having problems viewing the site, drop me a note. I've also updated the survey of <a href="professors/dylans_guitars.htm">Dylan's guitars</a> with some information from Paul Hostetter. </p>
<p><span class="date">Nov 20: </span>Have you installed <a target="_top" href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> yet? You should! Also, to all the XP users with flat screens (about 50% of you), I strongly recommend to activate ClearType. Follow directions at <a
 href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeInfo.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p><span class="date">Oct 29: </span><a href="00_misc/answerphone_message.htm">Answerphone Message</a> (Malibu, 1975), and the full tab for <a
 href="03_times/boots_of_spanish.htm">Boots of Spanish Leather</a></p>
<p><span class="date"> Oct 28: </span>Here's Charlie Daniels' version of his own <a
 href="00_misc/old_rocknroller.htm#daniels">Old Rock 'n' Roller</a></p>
<p><span class="date"> Oct 26:</span> I have finally, with a lot of input from Peter Stone Brown, put together <a href="professors/dylans_guitars.htm">some info</a> about the guitars Dylan has used throughout his carreer. It is by no means complete, so if there are pictures, guitars or comments that you think should <em>definitely </em>be included, let me know.</p>
<p><span class="date"> Oct 24: </span> I'm working my way through the remaining live covers from the early NET: <a href="00_misc/people_putting_people_down.htm">People Putting People Down</a> (Prine; Rome, June 6, 1991), <a
 href="00_misc/girl_on_the_green_briar_shore.htm">Girl on the Green Briar Shore</a> (live, 1992), <a href="00_misc/youre_too_late.htm">You're Too Late</a> (Frizzell/Willis; Daytona Beach, 1999), <a
 href="00_misc/the_harder_they_come.htm">The Harder They Come</a> (Jimmy Cliff; Bonner Springs, 22 Aug, 1989), and the often requested duets with Van Morrison: <a href="00_misc/crazy_love.htm">Crazy Love</a> and <a href="00_misc/one_irish_rover.htm">One Irish Rover</a> (June 27, 1989, Athens) </p>
<p><span class="date"> Oct 23:</span> A long time ago, I received a more precise transcription of the lyrics to <a href="17_basement/im_not_there.htm">I'm not there (1956)</a>. I've finally remembered to update the file. Then there is <a
 href="00_misc/when_first_unto_this_country.htm">When First Unto This Country</a> (live, 1991) </p>
<p><span class="date"> Oct 21: </span> <a href="00_misc/no_more_one_more_time.htm">No more one more time</a> (Oct 13, 2004)</p>
<p><span class="date">Oct 20: </span>Heinrich K&uuml;ttler has submitted a batch of transcriptions of variant lyrics to &quot;<a
 href="22_slowtrain/gotta_serve_somebody.htm">Gotta Serve Somebody</a>&quot; </p>
<p><span class="date"> Oct 19: </span>Big Joe Willams day today: <a
 href="00_misc/baby_please_dont_go.htm">Baby, Please Don't Go</a>, a <em>Freewheelin</em><em>'</em> outtake, and <a href="00_misc/deep_ellum_blues.htm">Deep Ellem Blues</a> (live, Gerde's, Apr 16, 1962)</p>
<p><span class="date"> Oct 17: </span>Seems that my long-time companion on the net, Kelvin Sherlock's site, has disappeared. <a href="34_bootleg/seven_curses.htm">Seven Curses</a> (<em>Bootleg Series 1&ndash;3</em>), <a
 href="36_wgw/two_soldiers.htm">Two Soldiers</a>, and <a
 href="03_times/restless_farewell.htm">Restless Farewell</a> were among the songs I hadn't tabbed out yet. Loads of requests, so here they are. More to come, too.... :-)</p>
<p><strong>May 15</strong>: Billy Cross has a new album out: <em>Life is 
    Good </em>- his first solo album in 30 years or so. It&#39;s a great album - he 
    has an ear for a memorable melody, his guitar playing is as good as ever, 
    and he must be the most charming musician Dylan has ever played with. :-) 
    Here are three songs from the album: <a href="others/billy_cross_life_is_good.htm">Life is Good</a>,&nbsp;
    <a href="others/billy_cross_i_dont_need_you.htm">I Don&#39;t Need You</a>, and
    <a href="others/billy_cross_you_cant_get_her.htm">You Can&#39;t Get Her Out of 
    Your Heart</a>. Consider this a recommendation to go
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000255LAW/qid=1084647107/sr=1-8/ref=sr_1_8/104-1783075-3441560?v=glance&s=music">
    somewhere</a> (or <a href="http://www.ginza.se/">somewhere else</a>)&nbsp; and order the album.<strong><br />
    May 2: </strong>The Halloween show, <a href="43_bs6/index.htm">
    Bootleg Series vol. 6 (Live 1964)</a> is ready, but my server isn&#39;t, so it 
    won&#39;t be uploaded yet.<br />
    <strong>Apr 29 2004: </strong>I know, it&#39;s been a while... I&#39;m not 
    dead, the site is not going down (I&#39;ve renewed the domain name for the 
    next 5 years), I&#39;ve just been busy following Dylan&#39;s advice: getting a life. 
    Anyway, here are two heavily requested rearrangements: first yet another 
    version of the new <a href="02_freewheelin/girl_from_the_north_country.htm#StLouis">Girl from 
    the North Country</a> arrangment, then the new
    <a href="04_anotherside/itaintme.htm#2004">It Ain&#39;t Me, Babe</a>. For Ball 
    and Bisquit, I suggest to go to the exellent White Stripes site in the
    <a href="links.htm">Links section</a>.</p>
<h2>Chords added 2003</h2>

<p> <strong>Nov 15: </strong>Added a more precise tab for
    <a href="07_bob/obviously_five_believers.htm">Obviously Five Believers</a>,<strong> </strong>
    and the intro to <a href="35_gaibty/hard_times.htm">Hard Times</a>.<strong> </strong>
    And <a href="00_misc/dixie.htm">Dixie</a> (from <em>Masked and Anonymous</em>) 
    was requested<strong><br />
    Nov 14: </strong>And just because I updated
    <a href="02_freewheelin/girl_from_the_north_country.htm#Dusseldorf">Girl from 
    the North Country</a>, Dylan came up with a new arrangement of it in 
    Dsseldorf (Nov 8)&nbsp; <strong><br />
    Oct 25: </strong>Updated <a href="02_freewheelin/girl_from_the_north_country.htm">Girl from 
    the North Country</a> with a better tab of the intro and the picking during 
    the verse<strong><br />
    Oct 21: </strong>
    Time to try a new design again (adapted from the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/augustana.html">Bibliotheca Augustana</a>). 
    Let me know if there are things that don&#39;t work well in the browser that you 
    use.<strong> <br />
    Oct 18: </strong>
    <a href="00_misc/i_will_love_him.htm">I Will Love Him</a> (Toronto, Apr 19, 
    1980)<strong><br />
    Oct 3: </strong>
    I just realized that I missed the sixth anniversary of My Back Pages. It was 
    more or less the same day the three Bromberg songs came out, however, so<strong> </strong>
    it was a nice birthday present. <strong><br />
    Oct 2: </strong>
    <a href="00_misc/blessed_is_the_name.htm">Blessed is the Name</a> (var. 
    1979-80)<strong><br />
    Sept 29: </strong>Three more songs from the Bromberg Sessions surfaced today:
    <a href="00_misc/sloppy_drunk.htm">Sloppy Drunk</a>,
    <a href="00_misc/catskill_serenade.htm">Catskill Serenade</a> and
    <a href="00_misc/polly_vaughn.htm">Polly Vaughn</a> (Bromberg sessions, 
    early/mid June 1992)<strong><br />
    Sept 18: </strong>Are you going to the north country fair, the concert in Stockholm Oct 11? If 
    so, you might want to consider going one day earlier, to catch the Dylan 
    tribute convention (or, if you're more comfortable with that: PARTY). Just 
    about every up and coming band in Sweden will be playing, as will a certain 
    upholder of a certain Dylan chord web site. More info
    <a href="http://www.blackside.org/dylan/en.htm">here</a>. <strong> <br />
July 22: </strong>
    <a href="00_misc/hiram_hubbard.htm">Hiram Hubbard</a> (Finjan Club, July 
    1962)<strong><br />
    July 21: </strong>
    <a href="11_newmorning/the_man_in_me.htm#1978">The Man In Me</a>, in its 
    Paris 1978 incarnation <strong><br />
    July 20: </strong>
    While I've been<strong> </strong>
    away<strong> </strong>
    this site seems to have become something of a celebrity because of the
    <a href="41_lat/textual_sources.htm">Junichi Saga saga</a>, which apparently 
    made it to front pages here and there (meanwhile, I made it to the top of 
    Brringen, the mountain of my dreams, so to speak). Here's the Dixie 
    Hummingbirds' version of <a href="00_misc/city_of_gold.htm#DixieH">City of 
    Gold</a>, from the <em>Masked and Anonymous </em>soundtrack.<br />
    <strong>June 17: </strong>
    <a href="00_misc/you_dont_know_me.htm">You Don't Know Me</a> (various 
    locations, 1989-1991)<strong><br />
    June 16: </strong>
    My favorite version of <a href="03_times/times_they_are_achangin.htm#1981">
    The Times They Are A-Changin'</a> (Drammen 10 July 1981)&nbsp; turned<strong> </strong>
    up on my doorstep the other day. It was actually one of the first songs I 
    intended to tab, way back in history ('97, I think it was), but somehow I 
    never did, and then the CD disappeared. Now I have it again . . . (and it 
    still is one of my favorites - the whole show)
    <strong><br />
May 30: </strong>
    A more elaborate tab for <a href="38_toom/dirtroad.htm">Dirt Road Blues</a> 
    was requested, I assume in anticipation of the version in <em>Masked and 
    Anonymous </em>(cause since it is not out yet, clearly nobody has heard it, 
    right? :-).<strong> </strong>
    I never said it is easy, but don't despair - it <em>is </em>playable... Then 
    there was this Greendale stuff from Neil Young, which has been haunting me 
    for a couple of weeks now - hey, one of these days I may even turn into a 
    Young fan... Anyway, here's <a href="others/neil_young_devils_sidewalk.htm">
    Devil's Sidewalk</a> <strong><br />
    May 29: </strong>
    Another Neil Young Greendale tab: <a href="others/neil_young_double_e.htm">
    Double E</a> (live, Oslo/Frankfurt, 
Apr/May 2003)<strong><br />
    May 23: </strong>
    Since tomorrow is such a special day (and such a long time, too) - that's 
    when Neil Young's current tour ends :-) - here's
    <a href="others/neil_young_bandit.htm">Bandit</a>, the highlight from Neil 
    Young's European &quot;Greendale&quot; tour (live, Oslo/Frankfurt, Apr/May 2003)<strong><br />
    May 15: </strong>
    <a href="05_biabh/mr_tambourine_man.htm#Budokan">Mr Tambourine man</a> from
    <em>Budokan</em>.<strong><br />
    May 12: </strong>Chris Johnson has read Junichi Saga's <em>Confessions of a Yakuza</em>, 
    and found a <a href="41_lat/textual_sources.htm">load of lines</a> that 
    strikingly resemble lines is a recent studio album by a certain American 
    icon (with a title that alludes to unlawful appropriation)&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>
    <br />
    May 10:</strong> The piano version of
    <a href="13_dylan/spanish_is_the_loving_tongue.htm#Outtake">Spanish Is The 
    Loving Tongue</a> (<em>New Morning </em>outtake, June 1970)<strong> </strong>is as good 
    as it gets, so it would be a shame to leave it out just because he plays on 
    the wrong instrument.<strong> </strong>I never said it was easy, but it is playable 
    .-)<strong><br />
    May 9: </strong><a href="00_misc/female_rambling_sailor.htm">
    Female Rambling Sailor</a> (played live six times in 1992). <br />
    And thank god it's spring. As they say in Toronto: &quot;It's spring, the Leaves 
    are out.&quot; I don't mind - Mats Sundin certainly found a way to make himself 
    useful elsewhere. Sorry Canada, but the only
    <a href="17_basement/one_single_river.htm">song for you</a> on Sunday will 
    be &quot;going down the road feeling bad&quot;. (If you don't understand a word of 
    what I'm saying here, you're probably not interested in hockey).<br />
    <strong>May 7: </strong><a href="00_misc/diamond_joe2.htm">Diamond Joe</a> 
    (from <em>Masked and Anonymous</em>, 2003). New outtake version of
    <a href="31_ohmercy/everything_is_broken.htm#Outtake">Everything is Broken</a><strong><br />
    April 30: </strong>The acoustic accompaniment to
    <a href="05_biabh/mr_tambourine_man.htm#1995">Mr Tambourine Man</a> from 
    1995<strong> </strong>has been requested, and that's a damned good request.<strong><br />
    April 29: </strong><a href="00_misc/its_hard_to_be_blind.htm">
    It's Hard To Be Blind</a> (Minnesota Party and Hotel Tapes, May/Dec 1961)<strong><br />
    April 27: </strong>Added the new version of
    <a href="22_slowtrain/change_my_way_of_thinking.htm">Change my Way of 
    Thinking</a>, and some T-Rex songs in the <a href="others/index.htm">
    &quot;Others&quot; folder</a><strong><br />
    April 24: </strong>Corrected an error at the end of
    <a href="09_nashville/tell_me_that_it_isnt_true.htm">Tell Me That It Isn't 
    True</a>.<strong> </strong>Also added the new version of
    <a href="38_toom/doorway_chords.htm#Austin2003">Standing in the Doorway</a> 
    (Austin, 20 April 2003). I also added
    <a href="00_misc/dusty_old_fairgrounds.htm">Dusty Old Fairgrounds</a> (Town 
    Hall, NY, 12 Apr 1963), and the Minnesota Party Tape version of
    <a href="17_basement/young_but_daily_growin.htm">Young But Daily 
    Growing/Long Time A-Growin'</a> (May 1961)<strong><br />
    April 12: </strong>A new Dylan recording has surfaced, a cover 
    version of Jimmie Rodgers's <a href="00_misc/mississippi_and_you.htm">Miss 
    the Mississippi and You</a>, from the Bromberg tapes (June 1992).<strong><br />
    Mar 2:</strong>&nbsp; A
    <a href="http://pool.dylantree.com/phorum/list.php?f=12">Bob Dylan Guitar 
    Forum</a> has been established at the <a href="http://pool.dylantree.com/">
    dylanpool</a>, thanks to ryan (who needed something to fill up his days now 
    that he has finished his exams - congratulations, ryan!) and Arthur, who put 
    it up.<strong> </strong>It will, as I see it, replace the Yahoo group My 
    Back Pages, as a more active forum for questions concerning Dylan and the 
    Guitar. Go there and prove me right!<br />
    <strong>Mar 1: </strong>Updated Christer Svensson's list of
    <a href="harp/harpkeys.htm">Harp keys</a> with Live 1975<strong><br />
    Feb 26: </strong>What appears to be a new site,
    <a href="http://digilander.libero.it/dylanchords/?">Strummin' on my gay 
    guitar</a>, contains chords to live versions of a lot of songs, mostly from 
    recent years. Since it is made as a &quot;complement&quot; to this site, it must be 
    good :-) (and I'm deeply honoured).<strong> </strong>Good initiative!<strong><br />
    Feb 19: </strong>I've done some updating of files here and there,
    among other things the full version of <a href="00_misc/cross_the_green_mountain.htm">Cross

    Jan 6, 2003: </strong>First of all: <strong>Godt nyttr, Happy new year, Bonan novjaron,
    etc. </strong>Second: a new addition to the &quot;Self-Ordained Professors&quot; section: <a href="professors/ritual_of_a_bob_dylan_concert_.htm"><em>&quot;Going Through These Things
    Twice&quot; - the Ritual of a Bob Dylan Concert</em></a>, which is a paper I held at a
    conference on &quot;postmodern medievalism&quot; (medievalism is defined as &quot;the
    ongoing (re)creation of the Middle Ages&quot;) - hence the emphasis on medieval ritual in
    the article). <br />
    And, yes, I promise - there will be some tabs here soon, too...</p>

complete.<strong><br />
Oct 6: </strong>Some tour opener: Three tribute songs to the same person in the same show
(someone said the last time that happened, it was Jesus...) - three Warren Zevon songs. I
haven't heard Dylan's versions yet, but here are Zevon's: <a

Aug 23: </strong>Here's a little gem for the Scandinavian guests, with a little story to
go with it: One of the few records I had in my house when I was a kid was this strange old
man<strong> </strong>called <a href="others/povel_ramel_karl_nilsson.htm">Karl Nilsson</a>
who sang a song about himself. Little by little I realized that it was hilariously funny,
and that the singer wasn't an old senile emigrant after all,<strong> </strong>but a
Swedish entertainer called Povel Ramel. Apparently, the tune is an old emigrant song, and
Karl Nilsson is slightly related to the protagonist of the Swedish film &quot;The
Emigrants&quot;, about emigrants to America. This is reflected in the penultimate verse
(and it's the only Dylan connection I could find). <strong><br />
Aug 20: </strong>Here's the Rundown Rehearsal version of <a
href="16_bott/youre_gonna_make_me_lonesome.htm#Rundown">You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When
You Go</a> from 1978.<strong><br />

From On High</a><strong> </strong>by Bill Monroe and Bessie Lee Mauldin, sung yesterday in
Hamburg, NY. The song has also been covered by the Stanley Brothers. Since I found the
songs one at a time, I've added all three versions<strong> </strong>(not that the
differences are <em>that</em> radical).<strong><br />
Aug 8: </strong>Safely back from Belgium (my, can they brew beer down there!), I've added
a new essay in the <a href="professors/index.htm"><em>Self-ordained Professors</em></a>

all). There is a small chance that I may get close to a computer, so if anyone makes an

&quot;yesterday's&quot; update was made at 2:45 AM<strong>, </strong>May 17. It's still
May 17 (and my fellow countrymen are running around waving Norwegian flags, drinking too
much beer, but not me, no - ) - I'm tabbing some late fall 1978 versions instead: <a

May 17: </strong>No tabs today, but some writing: <a href="16_bott/index.htm">Introductory
notes to Blood on the Tracks</a>, which for the most part is an introduction to Dylan's

unzip it to a new directory and open the file &quot;index.htm&quot; in the root directory,

any other problems.<br />

you exchange &quot;Marx&quot; for &quot;the shadow&quot; in <a

song as any, whereas <a href="00_misc/ill_not_be_a_stranger.htm">I'll Not Be A Stranger</a>
