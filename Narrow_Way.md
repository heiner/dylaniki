    B
    I'm gonna walk across the desert 'til I'm in my right mind.

    I won't even think about what I left behind.

    Nothing back there anyway I can call my own.

    Go back home, leave me alone.

    E                                         B
    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    F#                          E                                         B
    If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

    Ever since the British burned the White House down
    There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
    I saw you drinking of an empty cup
    I saw you buried, and I saw you dug up.

    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

    Look down, Angel from the skies!
    Help my weary soul to rise!
    I kissed the cheek, I dragged your plow.
    You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now.

    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

    In the courtyard of the golden sun
    You stand and fight, or you break and run.
    You went and lost your lovely head
    For a drink of wine and a crust of bread.

    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

    We looted and we plundered on distant shores.
    Why is my share not equal to yours?
    Your father left you, your mother too.
    Even death has washed its hands of you.

    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

    This is hard country to stay alive in.
    Blades are everywhere, and they're breaking my skin.
    I'm armed to the hilt, and I'm struggling hard.
    You won't get out of here unscarred.

    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    If I cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

    You got too many lovers wailin' at the wall.
    If I had a thousand tongues, I couldn't count them all.
    Yesterday, I could've thrown them all in the sea,
    Today, even one may be too much for me.

    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

    Cakewalking baby, you can do no wrong
    Put your arms around me where they belong.
    I won't take you on a roller coaster ride.
    Lay my hands all over ya, tie you to my side.

    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

    I've got a heavy-stacked woman with a smile on her face,
    And she has crowned my soul with grace.
    I'm still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
    I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts.

    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

    Been dark all night, but now it's dawn.
    The moving finger is moving on.
    You can guard me while I sleep,
    Kiss away the tears I weep.

    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.

    I love women, and she loves men.
    We've been to the West, and we're going back again.
    I heard a voice at the dusk of day
    Saying, "Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray."

    It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
    If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday.
