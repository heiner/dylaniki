    A                         E+
     Something about you that I can't shake
          F#m                        Dsus4
    Don't know how much more of this I can take
    D    Dm              A
    Baby, I'm under your spell.

    E

    I was knocked out an' loaded in the naked night
    When my last dream exploded I noticed your light
    Baby, oh what a story I could tell?

    A6 . . E+ |A . . E |
    D  . . Dm |A . . . |

    It's been nice seein' you, you read me like a book
    If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look
    Baby I'll be at the same hotel.

    I'd like to help you but I'm in a bit of a jam
    I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am
    Baby, caught between heaven an' hell.

    But I will be back, I will survive
    You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive
    Baby, can't you tell?

    Well it's four in the mornin' by the sounds of the birds
    I'm starin' at your picture, I'm hearin' your words
    Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.

    D
    Everywhere you go it's enough to break hearts
    A
    Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts
    D
    You where too hot to handle, you were breakin' every vow
    Cmaj7                       E
    I trusted you baby, you can trust me now.

    Turn back, baby, wipe your eye
    Don't think I'm leavin' here without a kiss goodbye
    Baby, is there anythin' left to tell?

    I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head
    Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead
    Baby, what more can I tell?

    When the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed
    Pray that I don't die of thirst
    Baby, two feet from the well.
