<h1 class="songtitle">World Gone Wrong</h1>


<p>Trad., arranged by Bob Dylan<br />
Released on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">World Gone Wrong</a> (1993)<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<p>Capo 2nd fret (Original key D major) </p>

<p>Chords: </p>
<pre class="chords">
C       x32010
Csus4   x33010
C+      x32110
Cmaj7   xx5500 (that's what he seems to be playing anyway.
               Otherwise it is usually played x32000)
</pre>

<p>The last line in every verse is given special treatment every
time. Sometimes he plays C F G C using only the strings 2, 3 and
4. Other times he goes straight to an F after the Cmaj7. It's all
mainly a flourish anyway, so... And the riff that follows is just as
variable. This is basically what he plays:</p>

Strange things have happened like never before

My baby told me I would have to go
  C+       F                  *      F
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
           G
I can't be good, baby

Honey, because the world gone wrong.

[Riff 1]

Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home
No use in worrying cause the world gone wrong
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby
Honey, because the world gone wrong.

I told you baby, right to your head
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby
Honey, cause the world gone wrong.

I tried to be lovin', and treat you kind
But it seem like you never right, you got no loyal mind
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby
Honey, cause the world's gone wrong.

If you had a woman and she don't treat you kind
Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby
Honey, because the world gone wrong.

Said, when you been good now, can't do no more
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door"
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.

Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
No use to ask me baby, cause I'll never be back
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
