    D7
    Everybody wants to know why he couldn't adjust

    Adjust to what, a dream that bust?
             A
    He was a clean-cut kid
             D7 [n.c.]
    But they made a killer out of him,

    That's what they did

    They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is
    They put ideas in his head he thought were his
    He was a clean-cut kid
    But they made a killer out of him,
    That's what they did

    He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
    When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand
    He was a clean-cut kid
    But they made a killer out of him,
    That's what they did

    He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
    For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out
    He was a clean-cut kid
    But they made a killer out of him,
    That's what they did

                G
    They said, "Listen boy, you're just a pup"
                       D7
    They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up
                  E
    They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
      A
    A jeep to drive, blood to spill

    They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes"
    They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes
    He was a clean-cut kid
    But they made a killer out of him,
    That's what they did

    He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
    The only game he could play was Russian roulette
    He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
    Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed

    He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole
    He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool
    They took a clean-cut kid
    And they made a killer out of him,
    That's what they did

    He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
    Could've been an accountant or a tennis star
    He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
    Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay

    His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
    They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own
    They took a clean-cut kid
    And they made a killer out of him,
    That's what they did

    Well, everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust
    All he ever wanted was somebody to trust
    They took his head and turned it inside out
    He never did know what it was all about

    He had a steady job, he joined the choir
    He never did plan to walk the high wire
    They took a clean-cut kid
    And they made a killer out of him,
    That's what they did
