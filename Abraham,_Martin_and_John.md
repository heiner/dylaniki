Written by Dick Holler  
Performed by Bob Dylan during the 1980 and 1981 gospel tours, in duet
with Clydie King.  
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Played with Bob at the piano, in C\# major. I'd strongly suggest a capo
on the 1st fret.

    C            Em  F                   C
     Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?
    C        Em                 F           C/e F
     Can you tell me where he's gone?
                      Gsus4   G
    He freed a lot of people,
           F                  C
    But it seems the good die young,
          F            G              F    C/e  Dm  C
    Now I just looked around and he's gone.

    Has anybody here seen my old friend John?
    Can you tell me where he's gone?
    He freed a lot of people,
    But it seems the good die young,
    Now I just looked around and he's gone.

    Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin?
    Can you tell me where he's gone?
    He freed a lot of people,
    But it seems the good die young,
    Now I just looked around and he's gone.

    F          G        F                C
    Didn't you love the things that they stood for?
    F           G      F                  C
    Didn't they try to find some good for you and me?
        Gm       F         C
    An' we'll be free, someday
    G11
    I know, free one day.

    Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby?
    Can you tell me where he's gone?
    Thought I see them walkin'
    Up over the hill
    With Abraham, Martin and John
    Abraham, Martin and John.
