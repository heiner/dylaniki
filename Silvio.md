    G    F    C    G

    G        F           C         G
    Stake my future on a hell of a past
    G            F           C         G
    Looks like tomorrow is a coming on fast
    G        F              C      G
    Ain't complaining about what I got
    G           F         C       G
    Seen better times but who has not.

    Silvio silver and gold
    Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
    Silvio I gotta go
    Find out something only dead men know.

    Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
    When I come and knockin' don't throw me no bone
    I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
    If you don't like it you can leave me alone.

    I can snap my fingers and require the rain
    From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
    I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
    And charm the whistle off an evening train.

    Silvio silver and gold
    Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
    Silvio I gotta go
    Find out something only dead men know

    Give what I got until I got no more
    I take what I get until I even the score
    You know I love you and further more
    When it is time to go you got an open door.

    I can tell your fancy I can tell your plain
    You give something up for ev'rything you gain
    Since ev'ry pleasure's got an edge of pain
    Pay for your ticket and don't complain.

    One of these days and it won't be long
    Going down the valley and sing my song
    I will sing it loud and sing it strong
    Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.

    Silvio silver and gold
    Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
    Silvio I gotta go
    Find out something only dead men know.
