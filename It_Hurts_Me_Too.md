    So run here baby, put your little hands in mine
              F                                Fm
    I got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind
                   C                    A7
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
    Ab              C
     it hurts me too.

    I want you babe just to understand
    I don't wanna be your boss babe, i just wanna be your man
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
    it hurts me too.

    Now when you go home, you don't have to get along
    Come back to me babe, where i live that's where you belong
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
    it hurts me too.

    I love you babe an' you know that it's true
    I wouldn't mistreat you baby, nothin' in this world is like you
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you, it hurts me too
    Yes when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
    it hurts me too.

    So run here baby, put your little hand in mine
    I got something to tell you, i know that will change your mind
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you
    Don't you know it, don't you know it hurts me too.
