Fat man lookin in a blade of steel

Thin man lookin at his last meal
F                      C
Hollow man lookin in a cottonfield
             F/g  C
For dignity

Wise man lookin in a blade of grass
Young man lookin in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookin through painted glass
For dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Years Eve
F                             C
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
       F                   C/e
I went into the city, went into the town
              Dm                   F/g
Went into the land of the midnight sun

<pre class="verse">
Searchin high, searchin low
Searchin everywhere I know
Askin the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breakin out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance
Of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou
She said I dont want nobody see me talkin to you
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I would've gone deeper, but there wasnt any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasnt any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said hed give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity

Footprints runnin cross the silver sand
Steps goin down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the bordertowns of despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat
I'm on the rollin river in a jerkin boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

Sick man lookin' for the doctors cure
Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what its gonna take
To find dignity
