<h1>Covenant Woman</h1>

<p>Words and Music by Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">Saved</a> </em>(1980)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>This is a song for the whole 1980 gospel band. The original key is F major. For guitar
only there seem to be two possibilities:<br>
Capo 3rd fret, chords of D major, or capo 5th fret, chords of C major.<br>
I'm sure he plays one of these on the album, but I'm not certain about which one. I seem
to hear a D minor chord type'ish sound in the second line, which would suggest the C major
version, but then again, the D version gives the pleasant A major at the end, and the
least awkward chords overall. </p>

Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
                                 Am        G
Way up yonder, great will be her reward.
C        Am     Em                     Dm
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
                                         Am    G
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.

<pre style="font-family : times">I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup.
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up
And I know He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you.</pre>

<pre style="font-family : times">And I just got to tell you
I do intend
To stay closer than any friend.
I just got to thank you
Once again
For making your prayers known
Unto heaven for me
And to you, always, so grateful
I will forever be.</pre>

<pre style="font-family : times">Covenant woman, intimate little girl
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world.
You know we are strangers in a land we're passing through.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant too.

And I just got to tell you
I do intend
To stay closer than any friend.
I just got to thank you
Once again
For making your prayers known
Unto heaven for me
And to you, always, so grateful
I will forever be.</pre>
