             B
    Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man

    So can a woman who passes herself off as a male

    They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer

    Preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed
                  E
    It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up

    He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
             B
    You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up

    Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down

                B        G#m                  E
    Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
            B
    Ain't no goin' back

    Hear ya got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names
    Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
    He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
    But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
    Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
    And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn
    in these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion
    Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.

    Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
    Ain't no goin' back

    There's a retired businessman named Red, cast down from heaven and he's out of his head
    He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
    He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
    He's not somebody that you play around with much
    Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is
    She'll do wondrous works with your fate
    Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed
    If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.

    Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
    Ain't no goin' back

    Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight
    You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors
    How to enter into the gates of paradise
    No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
    Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks
    A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
    They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in
    Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks

    Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
    Ain't no goin' back

    They got some beautiful people out there, man
    They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
    They got mystery written all over their forehead
    They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
    They don't believe in mercy
    Judgment on them is something that you'll never see
    They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
    Turn you into anything that they want you to be

    Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
    Ain't no goin' back

    Yes, I guess I loved him too
    I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill
    Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
    Struck down by the strength of the will
    Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid
    From now on, this'll be where you're from
    Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come
    Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade

    Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
    Ain't no goin' back
