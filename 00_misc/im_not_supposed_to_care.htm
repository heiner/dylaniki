<h1 class="songtitle">I'm Not Supposed To Care</h1>


<p>Words and music Gordon Lightfoot<br />
Performed by Bob Dylan three times in May 1998<br />
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p>

<hr />

<p>A beautiful tune! Much of the effect lies in the hypnotically
ever-descending bass line, with subtly changing chords above it. Also,
the ornaments in the band turn a quite simple country(ish) ballad into
something quite complex.</p>

It's some kind of a game
