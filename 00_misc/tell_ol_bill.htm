<pre>Intro:
G . . .  D . . . . D . . . G . . . </pre>

<pre class="verse">
G                        D
The river whispers in my ear,
                         G
I've hardly a penny to my name.
                            D
The heavens never seemed so near.
                          G
All of my body glows with flame.</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
C                             G
 The tempest struggles in the air.
C                      G
 and to myself alone I sing.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
D
It could sink me then and there,
                      G
I can hear the echoes ring.
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
C                          G
 I try to find one smilin' face
C                            G
 to drive the shadows from my head.</pre>
<pre class="verse">
                              D
I'm stranded in this nameless place,
                          G
lyin' restless in a heavy bed

<pre>
Tell me straight out if you will,
Why must you torture me within?
Why must you come down from your high hill?
Throw my fate to the clouds and wind
  Far away in a silent land
  Secret thoughts are hard to bear.
Remember me, you'll understand:
Emotions we can never share.
  You trampled on me as you passed,
  Left the coldest kiss upon my brow.
All my doubts and fears are gone at last,
I've nothing more to tell you now.
</pre>

<pre>
I walk by tranquil lakes and streams
As each new season's dawn awaits
I lay awake at night with troubled dreams
The enemy is at the gates
  Beneath the thunder-blasted trees
  the words are ringing off your tongue
the ground is hard in times like these
the stars are cold, the night is young,
  the rocks are bleak, the trees are bare,
  iron clouds go floating by.
Snowflakes falling in my hair
beneath the gray and stony sky.
</pre>

<pre>
The evening sun is sinking low,
the woods are dark, the town is too.
They'll drag you down, they run the show.
Ain't no tellin' what they'll do.
  Tell ol' Bill when he comes home:
  Anything is worth a try.
Tell him that I'm not alone,
that the hour has come to do or die.
  All the world I would defy,
  Let me make it plane as day.
I look at you now and I sigh,
how could it be any other way?
