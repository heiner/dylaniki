1989 (thanks to Martina Henze). <br />
Played by Dylan in Hamburg, 3 July 1990, and introduced with the

here's a song to tell about it&rdquo;.<br />

He's just an old rock 'n' roller playing music in a backstreet bar.

He sings a little flat and he never learned to play the guitar.
       Am                        Em
But he keeps on belting out them rhythm and blues
F                      C
&quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; and &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;
   Am                             Em               F
He never faced the fact that he's never gonna be a star.
             C                           G                     C
He's just an old rock 'n' roller playing music in a backstreet bar.

He had a record in the sixties, it was big enough to go Top Ten.
And though he tried and he tried he never could make it happen again.
He's been living twenty years on bourbon and pride.
Jerry Lee went crazy and Elvis died.
Then his third wife left him but he never really thought it would last.
And now she ain't nothing but another little blast from the past.

He steps up on the mike with a gleam in his eye

and once again he's twenty-one.

Then the Sweet Bird of Youth just flies away.

He's an earthbound eagle that never did learn how to fly.
He ain't never gonna make it but he sure did give it a try.
So go dye your hair and turn the music up loud,
And when it's time to go at least you'll go down proud.
You ain't never gonna be nothing but what you are &ndash;

<p>*) One guitar plays an F here.</p>

<p>**) No specific chord is discernible here; several alternatives are
played simultaneously... <strong>Am</strong> is a good guess, which makes
sense musically.</p>
