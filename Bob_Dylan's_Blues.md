    Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto

    They are ridin' down the line

    Fixin' ev'rybody's troubles
                 C
    Ev'rybody's 'cept mine
                   G
    Somebody musta tol' 'em
         C (C/b) D/a  G
    That I was   doin' fine

    [1 verse harmonica solo:

    G' . .  . |        G' = xxx087
    G' . .  . |        G7'= xxx065
    G' . G7'. |

    Oh you five and ten cent women
    With nothin' in your heads
    I got a real gal I'm lovin'
    And Lord I'll love her till I'm dead
    Go away from my door and my window too
    Right now

    Lord, I ain't goin' down to no race track
    See no sports car run
    I don't have no sports car
    And I don't even care to have one
    I can walk anytime around the block

    Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me
    Up and down the street
    With my hat in my hand
    And my boots on my feet
    Watch out so you don't step on me

    Well, lookit here buddy
    You want to be like me
    Pull out your six-shooter
    And rob every bank you can see
    Tell the judge I said it was all right
    Yes!
