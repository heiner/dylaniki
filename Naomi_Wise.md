    [1 verse instr. intro]

                    G                  C
    She promised to meet him at Adams' Spring
                   D                        G
    Expecting some money or some other fine things

    No money, no money to flatter the case
    We'll have to get married so there'll be no disgrace

    So jump you up Omie, and away we will ride
    To yonder fair country and I'll make you my bride

    She jumped up behind him and away they did go
    to yonder far country where the deep waters flow

    Now jump you down Omie and I'll telly my mind
    My mind is to drowned you and to leave you behind

    Oh no, oh no, please don't take my life
    Oh I will deny you and I'll not be your wife

    But he kicked and he cuffed her to the worst understand
    And he threw her in deep water that flows through the land

    They found the poor body the following day
    Run up on the river on the banks full of clay *)

    And up spoke her mother with a voice such a-sting
    No one but John Lewis could have done such a thing

    They traced him up the river to Dutch Charlie's bend
    Where they found him in jail for killing a man

    Go hang him, go hang him was the mother's command
    Through him in deep water that flows through the land

    Go hang him, go hang him was the judge's command
    Through him in deep water that flows through the land
