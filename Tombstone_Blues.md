    With the tombstone blues

    The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
    Screaming she moans, "I've just been made"
    Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
    Says, "My advice is to not let the boys in"

    Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
    He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
    "Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
    You will not die, it's not poison"

    Mama's in the fact'ry
    She ain't got no shoes
    Daddy's in the alley
    He's lookin' for food
    I'm in the kitchen
    With the tombstone blues

    Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
    Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
    Saying, "Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
    Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"

    The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
    Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry"
    And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
    Saying, "The sun's not yellow it's chicken"

    Mama's in the fact'ry
    She ain't got no shoes
    Daddy's in the alley
    He's lookin' for food
    I'm in the kitchen
    With the tombstone blues

    The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
    Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
    Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
    Then sends them out to the jungle

    Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
    With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
    With a fantastic collection of stamps
    To win friends and influence his uncle

    Mama's in the fact'ry
    She ain't got no shoes
    Daddy's in the alley
    He's lookin' for food
    I'm in trouble
    With the tombstone blues

    The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
    Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
    At Delilah who's sitting worthlessly alone
    But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

    Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
    I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
    Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
    He could die happily ever after

    Mama's in the fact'ry
    She ain't got no shoes
    Daddy's in the alley
    He's lookin' for food
    I'm in the kitchen
    With the tombstone blues

    Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
    Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
    And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
    To the old folks home and the college

    Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
    That could hold you dear lady from going insane
    That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
    Of your useless and pointless knowledge

    Mama's in the fact'ry
    She ain't got no shoes
    Daddy's in the alley
    He's lookin' for the fuse
    I'm in the streets
    With the tombstone blues

streets”

(recorded nov 1994)

The G is a bluesy mix of G major and minor (exactly the same used in

The following riff is played by one of the guitars throughout the song,
where there's a line with G.
