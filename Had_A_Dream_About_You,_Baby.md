    A
    I got to see you baby, I don't care

    It may be some place, baby, you say you where
            F#m              D      A
    I had a dream about you, baby
      F#m              D     A
    A dream about you, baby
    F#m                        D                 A
    Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.

    You got the crazy rhythm when you walk
    You make me nervous when you start to talk
    I had a dream about you, baby
    A dream about you, baby
    Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.

    Standin' on the highway, you flag me down
    Said, take me, daddy, to the nearest town
    I had a dream about you, baby
    Had a dream about you, baby
    Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.

    D
    The join is jumpin' it's really somethin'
    A
    The beat is pumpin, my heart is thumpin'
    B
    Spent my money on you honey
       E
    My limbs are shakin, my heart is breakin'

    You kiss me, baby, in the coffee stop
    You made me so bad, you gotta stop
    I had a dream about you, baby
    Had a dream about you, baby
    Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.

    The join is jumpin' it's really somethin'
    The beat is pumpin, my heart is thumpin'
    Spent my money on you honey
    My limbs are shakin, my heart is breakin'

    You had a white rag wrapped around your head
    Wearing a long dress fire engine red
    I had a dream about you, baby
    Had a dream about you, baby
    Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.
