    G   C/g G

             G
    Ain't it just like the night
            C                  D               G      C/g G
    to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
       G
    We sit here stranded,
                 C             D         G
    though we're all doin' our best to deny it
        D
    And Louise holds a handful of rain,
                      G         C/g G
    temptin' you to defy it
           C                         G
    Lights flicker from the opposite loft
       C                             G
    In this room the heat pipes just cough
        C                           G
    The country music station plays soft
                                                D
    But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
            G           C     D    G
    Just Louise and her lover so entwined
              C          G/b          D          G
    And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

    In the empty lot where the ladies play
    blindman's bluff with the key chain
    And the all-night girls
    they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train
    We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
    Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
    Louise, she's all right, she's just near
    She's delicate and seems like the mirror                    1)
    But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
    That Johanna's not here
    The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
    Where these visions of Johanna
    have now taken my place

    Now, little boy lost,
    he takes himself so seriously
    He brags of his misery,
    he likes to live dangerously
    And when bringing her name up
    He speaks of a farewell kiss to me                          2)
    He's sure got a lotta gall
    to be so useless and all
    Muttering small talk at the wall
    while I'm in the hall
    How can I explain?
    Oh, it's so hard to get on
    And these visions of Johanna,
    they kept me up past the dawn

    Inside the museums,
    Infinity goes up on trial
    Voices echo this is what
    salvation must be like after a while
    But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
    You can tell by the way she smiles
    See the primitive wallflower freeze
    When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
    Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeeze
    I can't find my knees"
    Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
    But these visions of Johanna,
    they make it all seem so cruel

    The peddler now speaks                                      3)
    to the countess who's pretending to care for him
    Sayin', "Name me someone that's not a parasite
    and I'll go out and say a prayer for him"
    But like Louise always says
    "Ya can't look at much, can ya man?"
    As she, herself, prepares for him
    And Madonna, she still has not showed
    We see this empty cage now corrode
    Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
    The fiddler, he now steps to the road
    He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
    On the back of the fish truck that loads
    While my conscience explodes
    The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
    And these visions of Johanna
    are now all that remain

Textual variants in the ''No Direction Home ''version:

1) Like silk, she seems like the mirror

2) . . . of her farewell . . .

3) Last verse:

The fiddler now plays  
for the countess who's pretending to care for him  
He says, "Name me someone that's not a parasite  
and I'll say a prayer for him"  
But like Louise says  
"Ya can't look at much, can ya man"  
As she, herself, prepares for him  
Madonna, she still has not showed  
We see the empty cage now corrode  
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed  
The peddler, he now steps to the road  
ev'rything's gone which was owed  
he examines the nightingale's code  
Still written on the fish truck that loads  
my conscience explodes  
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain  
And these visions of Johanna  
are all that remain
