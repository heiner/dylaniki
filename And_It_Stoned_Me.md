    Half a mile from the county fair
    And the rain keep pourin' down
    Me and Billy standin' there
    With a silver half a crown
    Hands are full of a fishin' rod
    And the tackle on our backs
    We just stood there gettin' wet
    With our backs against the fence

    Oh, the water
    Oh, the water
    Oh, the water
    Hope it don't rain all day

    Chorus:
    And it stoned me to my soul
    Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
    And it stoned me
    And it stoned me to my soul
    Stoned me just like goin' home
    And it stoned me

    Then the rain let up and the sun came up
    And we were gettin' dry
    Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
    So we jumped right in and the driver grinned
    And he dropped us up the road
    We looked at the swim and we jumped right in
    Not to mention fishing poles

    Oh, the water
    Oh, the water
    Oh, the water
    Let it run all over me

    Chorus

    On the way back home we sang a song
    But our throats were getting dry
    Then we saw the man from across the road
    With the sunshine in his eyes
    Well he lived all alone in his own little home
    With a great big gallon jar
    There were bottles too, one for me and you
    And he said Hey! There you are

    Oh, the water
    Oh, the water
    Oh, the water
    Get it myself from the mountain stream

    Chorus
