       G                Eb7
    We three, we're all alone,
    G          (F# F) E
    Living in a memory,
       Am       D(9)        G   G#o  Am   D(7-9)
    My echo, my shadow, and me.
       G                  Eb      7
    We three, we're not a crowd,
    G             (F# F) E
    We're not even company,
       Am       D           G     C/g   G   G7
    My echo, my shadow, and me.

    G7
    What good is the moon,

    The silvery moon,
         C(maj7)
    That shines above?
      A7
    I walk with my shadow,

    I talk with my echo
        D9                 D7
    But where is the one I love?

       G                     Eb7
    We three, we'll wait for you
    G          F# F E
    Even 'til eternity,
       Am       D7          G
    My echo, my shadow, and me.
