                     C      F    C
    Why do I have to choose
           F         C      F    C
    and see everybody lose?
                             G
    Walk around and sing the blues,
                       C
    Well, darling, I refuse.

    Love is hard to find
    Love of any kind
    And love like yours and mine
    Creates its own design.

    Why do I have to choose
    and see everybody lose?
    Walk around and sing the blues,
    Oh, darling, I refuse.

    When I think of her,
    then I think of you,
    The love is not the same,
    but either love is true.

    Why do I have to choose
    see everybody lose
    Walk around and sing the blues,
    Well, darling, I refuse.
