Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Dylan's lyrics differ slightly from Williams' (i.e. Rose's), which is
the basis for the version below.  
I have included some additional verses not sung by Dylan at the end of
the file.

The chords at the end are the outcome of a clash between the C chords of
the guitars and the D in the bass.

    G                                 C          G
    When the road is rocky and you're carrying a load

    Wait for the light to shine
    G                                     C               G
    If you find you're friendless on that weary, lonesome road
    G            D        G
    Wait for the light to shine

    He may be in trouble, he may need a helping hand
    Wait for the light to shine

Additional verses, not sung by Bob Dylan

</h2>
    If your life is empty and you're on your last go-round
    Wait for the light to shine
    If you hear the chime-knells on the highway you have found
    Wait for the light to shine

       Wait for the light to shine
       Wait for the light to shine
       When your friends forsake you and you haven't got a dime
       Wait for the light to shine

    Don't let trouble fool you and your sins will all be gone
    Wait for the light to shine
    Don't forget it's darkest just before the break of dawn
    Wait for the light to shine

       Wait for the light to shine
       Wait for the light to shine
       Keep these words before you as you walk that narrow line
       Wait for the light to shine
