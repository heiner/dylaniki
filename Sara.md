Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on [[Desire]] (1976), and in a live version on [[Live 1975]] (2002)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

The Am in the chorus (second “Sara”) sounds like a C on the album
because of the bass, but Am is definitely what he used to play in
concert, and it sounds better too.

The ''Live 1975'' version is virtually identical to the album
version, except for some lyric changes (see below).

<pre class="verse">
  Em                Am
I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky,
         D                        Em
When the children were babies and played on the beach.
    Em                   Am
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
         D                   Em
You were always so close and still within reach.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
G Bm  Am
Sara, Sara,
D                         C           Em
Whatever made you want to change your mind?
G Bm  Am
Sara, Sara,
D                      C       Em
So easy to look at, so hard to define.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
I can still see them playin' with their pails in the sand,
They run to the water their buckets to fill.
I can still see the shells fallin' out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
Sara, Sara,
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Sara, Sara,
Radiant jewel, mystical wife.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Sleepin' in the woods by a fire in the night,
Drinkin' white rum in a Portugal bar,
Them playin' leapfrog and hearin' about Snow White,
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.  *)
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
Sara, Sara,
It's all so clear, I could never forget,
Sara, Sara,
Lovin' you is the one thing I'll never regret.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Stayin' up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Writin' "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
Sara, Sara,
Wherever we travel we're never apart.
Sara, oh Sara,
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
How did I meet you? I don't know.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.    **)
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
Sara, oh Sara,
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Sara, Sara,
You must forgive me my unworthiness.
</pre>
<pre class="verse">
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore.
You always responded when I needed your help,
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
</pre>
<pre class="refrain">
Sara, oh Sara,
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Sara, oh Sara,
Don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
</pre>

Lyric changes in the ''Live 1975'' version:

<nowiki>*</nowiki>) Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night<br>
where you fought for my soul and went up against the odds<br>
I was too young to know you were doing it right<br>
and you did it with strength that belonged to the gods.

The order of the two following refrains is reversed.

<nowiki>*</nowiki><nowiki>*</nowiki>) This verse is left out from the ''Live 1975 ''
