    Hollis Brown

    He lived on the outside of town

    With his wife and five children

    And his cabin broken down

    cabin broken down

    You looked for work and money
    And you walked a rugged mile
    You looked for work and money
    And you walked a rugged mile
    Your children are so hungry
    That they don't know how to smile

    Your baby's eyes look crazy
    They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
    Your baby's eyes look crazy
    They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
    You walk the floor and wonder why
    With every breath you breathe

    [Additional verse in the Gaslight version:
    There's bedbugs on your baby's bed
    There's chinches on your wife
    There's bedbugs on your baby's bed
    There's chinches on your wife
    Gangerene snuck in your side,
    It's a-cuttin' you like a knife.]

    The rats have got your flour
    Bad blood it got your mare
    The rats have got your flour
    Bad blood it got your mare
    If there's anyone that knows
    Is there anyone that cares?

    You prayed to the Lord above
    Oh please send you a friend
    You prayed to the Lord above
    Oh please send you a friend
    Your empty pockets tell yuh
    That you ain't a-got no friend

    Your babies are crying louder now
    It's pounding on your brain
    Your babies are crying louder now
    It's pounding on your brain
    Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
    like the dirty drivin' rain

    Your grass it is turning black
    There's no water in your well
    Your grass is turning black
    There's no water in your well
    You spent your last lone dollar
    On seven shotgun shells

    Way out in the wilderness
    A cold coyote calls
    Way out in the wilderness
    A cold coyote calls
    Your eyes fix on the shotgun
    That's hangin' on the wall

    Your brain is a-bleedin'
    And your legs can't seem to stand
    Your brain is a-bleedin'
    And your legs can't seem to stand
    Your eyes fix on the shotgun
    That you're holdin' in your hand

    There's seven breezes a-blowin'
    All around the cabin door
    There's seven breezes a-blowin'
    All around the cabin door
    Seven shots ring out
    Like the ocean's pounding roar

    There's seven people dead
    On a South Dakota farm
    There's seven people dead
    On a South Dakota farm
    Somewhere in the distance
    There's seven new people born.

The Gaslight II version (late oct 1962) is basically the same as the
above (with the extra verse), only not as persistently regular (the bass
pattern changes more, and more unpredictably), and with the capo on the
5th fret.
