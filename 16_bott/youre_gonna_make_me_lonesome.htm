<pre class="verse">
E                 Emaj7
I've seen love go by my door
     A
It's never been this close before
E             Emaj7      B11
Never been so easy or so slow.
     E               Emaj7
Been shooting in the dark too long
     A
When somethin's not right it's wrong
E                    B11               E . . .
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.


Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love,
It always has hit me from below.
But this time around it's more correct
Right on target, so direct,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Purple clover, Queen Anne lace,
Crimson hair across your face,
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of
You might be spoilin' me too much, love,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
B11                               E
Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy,
B11                                E
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme,
F#
 Blue river runnin' slow and lazy,
A'
I could stay with you forever
    B'
And never realize the time.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Situations have ended sad,
Relationships have all been bad.
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud.
But there's no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm doin',
Stayin' far behind without you.
Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm sayin',
Yer gonna make me give myself a good talkin' to.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
I'll look for you in old Honolulu,
San Francisco, Ashtabula,
Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know.
But I'll see you in the sky above,
In the tall grass, in the ones I love,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
</pre>
