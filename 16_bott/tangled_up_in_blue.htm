Tangled up in blue.

E . . A | x3

She was married when they first met,
Soon to be divorced.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But he used a little too much force.
They drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at him
As he was walkin' away
she said: &quot;This can't be the end,                    . . . this ain't the end,
We'll meet on another day, on the avenue,&quot;           We'll meet again some day . . .
Tangled up in blue.

He had a job in the old north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But he never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
Well, he drifted down to L.A.
Where he reckoned to try his luck
Workin' for a while on an airplane plant,
Loading cargo onto a truck
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind,
He seen a lot of women
But she never escaped his mind, and he just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept looking' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on, as the crowd thinned out
I's about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, &quot;What's your name?&quot;
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
&quot;I thought you'd never say hello,&quot; she said
&quot;You look like the silent type.&quot;
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

He was always in a hurry,
too busy or too stoned,
And everything that she ever planned,
just a-had to be postponed.
She thought they were successful,
She thought they were blessed,                          He thought . . .
with objects and material things,
but I never was impressed.
And when it all came crashing down,
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are doctors' wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,
Tangled up in blue.

Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat

There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.

And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.

We drove that car as far as we could
We abandoned it way out West
Splittin' up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing that it was best.
She turned around to look at me
One more time, as I was walkin' away
Sayin' over her shoulder,
&quot;Boy, We're bound to meet again someday on the avenue,&quot;
Tangled up in blue.

I remember stayin' in the north woords
Living in a vagabond hotel
One day there in the pouring rain
I could feel how the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
And I was lucky not to be destroyed
I almost died from [...]
Two miles outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was dancin' in the Flamingo hotel
And I was passin' by, so I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept starin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same,
She was standing there right behind my chair
Toughing me said: &quot;You know it ain't no accident that you came.&quot;
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove, wearin' a dress made up of stars and stripes
&quot;I thought you'd never say hello,&quot; she said
&quot;You know you look like you could be the silent type.&quot;
Then she opened up the Bible
And she started quotin' it to me
Jeremiah chapter seventeen
From verses 21 and 33.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night,
There was revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of her froze.
She had to sell everything she owned
Even her jewellery and her clothes.
And when it all came crashing on, I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her and be brave.
All the people we used to know,
At least the ones that ain't in the grave,
Some are bricklayers, some are bankrobbers
Some are burglars and some are truck-drivers' wives.
I Don't know how it all got started,
I have no idea what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,

She was married when they first met,
to a man four times her age.
He left her penniless, in the state of regret,
it was time to bust out of the cage.
They drove that car as far as they could,
abandoned it out west.
splitting up on a dark, sad night,
both agreeing that it was best.
And she turned around to look at him
as he was walking away.
She said I wish I could tell you all the things
that I never learned how to say.
He said thats alright babe I love you too,
but we were tangled up in blue.

He had a steady job and a pretty face,
and everything seemed to fit.
One day he could just feel the waste,
he put it all down and split.
And he headed down to New Orleans,
where they treated him like a boy.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge,
he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
And all the time he was alone,
the past was close behind.
he had one too many lovers then,
and none of them were too refined,
all except for you,
but you were tangled up in blue.

She was working in the blinding light,
and I stopped in for a drink.
I just kept looking at her face so white,
I didn't know what to think.
Later on as the crowd thinned out,
I was getting ready to leave.
She was standing there, beside my chair,
saying &quot;What's that you got up your sleeve?&quot;
I said &quot;nothing baby, and thats for sure&quot;
She leaned down into my face.
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her
as she bent down to tie the laces
of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague street
in a basement down the stairs.
There was snow all winter and no heat,
revolution was in the air.
Then one day all his slaves ran free,
and something inside of him died.
The only thing I could do was be me,
and get on that train and ride.
And when it all came crashing down,
I was already south.
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round,
I had the worst taste in my mouth,
that I ever knew,
Tangled up in blue.

Now I'm going back again,
maybe tomorrow, maybe next year.
I've got to find someone among the women and men
whose destiny is unclear.
Some are ministers of illusion,
some are masters of the trade.
All under strong delusion,
all of their beds unmade.
Me I'm heading toward the sun,
trying to stay out of the joints.
We always did love the very same one.
We just saw her from a different point
of view,
Tangled up in blue.

G                     F
Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
G                F
He was layin' in bed
G                  F
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
       C
If her hair was still red.
    G                          F
Her folks they said that their lives together
G                 F
Sure was gonna be rough
     G                     F
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
       C
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
    D                      Em
And he was standin' on the side of the road
G                   Gsus4   G
Rain fallin' on his shoes
D                   Em
Heading out for the East Coast
G                       C/g  G       D
Lord knows he paid some dues getting through
F       C     G
Tangled up in blue.
