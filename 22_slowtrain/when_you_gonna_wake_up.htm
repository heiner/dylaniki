Am             Dm7                    Am
God don't make promises that He don't keep.
             Dm7                                                         Am
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.

Am                      Dm Dm   Am
When you gonna wake up,

when you gonna wake up
Am                      Dm Dm   Am

<pre class="verse">
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts.
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat, Henry Kissinger's got you tied up in knots.

You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never cure your ills.

You got men who can't hold their peace and women who can't control their tongues,
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.

Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.

Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved.

Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires.

You can't take it with you and you know that it's too worthless to be sold,
They tell you, &quot;Time is money&quot; as if your life was worth its weight in gold.

There's a Man up on a cross and He's been crucified.
Do you have any idea why or for who He died?
