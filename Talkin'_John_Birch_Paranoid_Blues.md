    [this is called: Talkin' John Birch Blues.
    And there ain't nothing wrong with this song]

                G               C
    Well, I was feelin' sad and kind'a blue,
      D
    I didn't know what I was a-gonna do,
         G                C
    Them Communists wus a-comin' around,
             D
    They wus in the air,

    They wus on the ground.
                               G . C . D . . G . . .
    They wus all over.

    So I run down most hurriedly
    And joined the John Birch Society,
    got me a secret membership card
    And went back home to the yard,
    Started lookin' on the sidewalk,
    under the hedges.

    Well, I got up in the mornin' 'n' looked under my bed,
    I wus lookin' every place for them gol-darned Reds.
    Looked behind the sink, and under the floor,
    Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
    Couldn't find any . . .

    Looked behind the clothes, behind my chair
    lookin' for them reds everywhere
    looked up my chimney hole,
    even deep down inside my toilet bowl,
    They got away . . .

    I heard some foot-steps by the front porch door,
    so I grabbed my shot-gun from the floor.
    Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
    saying "Hands up, you communist!"
    It was the mailman.
    He punched me out.

    Well, I wus sittin' home alone an' started to sweat,
    Figured they wus in my T.V. set.
    I peeked behind the picture frame,
    Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
    Them Reds did it!
    Hootenanny Television . . .

    Well, I quit my job so I could work alone,
    got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes.
    Followed some clues from my detective bag
    And discovered: red stripes on the American flag!
    Betsy Ross . . .

    Now Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
    Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
    To my knowledge there's just one man
    That's really a true American:
    That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
    I know for a fact he hates Commies cus he picketed the movie Exodus.

    Well, I fin'ly started thinkin' straight
    When I run outa things to investigate.
    Couldn't imagine nothing else,
    So now I'm home investigatin' myself!
    Hope I don't find out too much . . . Good God!

Verses not sung in the released version:

    Now we all agree with Hitlers' views,
    Although he killed six million Jews.
    It don't matter too much that he was a Fascist,
    At least you can't say he was a Communist!
    That's to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria.

    Well, I investigated all the books in the library,
    Ninety percent of 'em gotta be burned away.
    I investigated all the people that I knowed,
    Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go.
    The other two percent are fellow Birchers . . . just like me.

    It's a fictitious story..."]

    Well, I was feelin' sad and kind of blue,
    I didn't know what I was gonna do,
    The Communists were comin' around,
    They were in the air,
    They were on the ground.
    They were all over.

    So I ran down most hurriedly
    And joined the John Birch Society,
    I got me a secret membership card
    went back to my back yard,
    Started lookin'
    on the sidewalk,
    'neath the rose bush.

    I wus lookin' everywhere for them gol-darned Reds,
    I got up in the mornin' looked under my bed,
    Looked behind the kitchen, behind the door,
    even tore loose the kitchen floor,
    Couldn't find any . . .

    I looked beneath the sofa, beneath the chair
    lookin' for them reds everywhere
    I looked way up my chimney hole,
    even deep down inside my toilet bowl,
    They got away . . .

    I heard some foot-steps by the front porch door,
    so I grabbed my shot-gun from the floor.
    Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
    saying "Hands up, you communist!"
    It was the mailman.
    He punched me out.

    Well, I quit my job so I could work alone,
    got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes.
    Following some clues from my detective bag
    I discovered there was red stripes on the American flag!
    Did you know about Betsy Ross . . .?

    Well, I was sittin' home alone an' I started to sweat,
    I figured they wus in my television set.
    I peeked behind the picture frame,
    Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
    Them Reds did it!
    The ones on Hootenanny!

    Well, I fin'ly started thinkin' straight
    When I run outa things to investigate.
    I couldn't imagine doing anyhing else,
    So now I'm home investigatin' myself!
    Hope I don't find out too much . . . Good God!
