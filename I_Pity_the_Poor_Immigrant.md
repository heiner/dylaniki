    [Harmonica intro: first four lines] 

    C               F
    I pity the poor immigrant
        G                         C
    Who wishes he would've stayed home,
             C                   F
    Who uses all his power to do evil
               G                      C
    But in the end is always left so alone.
         Am                Em
    That man whom with his fingers cheats
            F               C
    And who lies with ev'ry breath,
        C            F
    Who passionately hates his life
        G                   C
    And likewise, fears his death.

    I pity the poor immigrant
    Whose strength is spent in vain,
    Whose heaven is like Ironsides,
    Whose tears are like rain,
    Who eats but is not satisfied,
    Who hears but does not see,
    Who falls in love with wealth itself
    And turns his back on me.

    I pity the poor immigrant
    Who tramples through the mud,
    Who fills his mouth with laughing
    And who builds his town with blood,
    Whose visions in the final end
    Must shatter like the glass.
    I pity the poor immigrant
    When his gladness comes to pass.
