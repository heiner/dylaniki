<h1 class="songtitle">God Knows</h1>


<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br />
Recorded &ndash; and discarded &ndash; for <em>Oh Mercy</em>, but given a second
chance on <a class="recordlink" href="index.htm">Under The Red Sky</a> (1990).<br />
May not have come out perfectly in the studio, but live this is a gem.</p>

<p>I give two versions: one with G chords, the other with E chords. Both
seem to have been used, but what he plays in concerts it is actually
the E version, although the intro (before the band enters) sounds
suspiciously like his dear old G-C/g-G turn.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="songversion"><em>Under the Red Sky</em> version</h2>

<p>Capo 3rd fret (sounding key Bb major)</p>

<p>The last three verses are played without the G+ - Em/b in the second
half &ndash; just plain G-C/g all the way through.</p>

<pre class="verse">
G                    C/g
 God knows you ain't pretty,
G               C/g
 God knows it's true.
G                G+
 God knows there ain't anybody
     Em/b                       G
Ever gonna take the place of you.

God knows it's a struggle,
God knows it's a crime,
God knows there's gonna be no more water
But fire next time.
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
C
God don't call it treason,
G
God don't call it wrong,
A
It was s'posed to last a season
             D
But it's been so strong for so long.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
God knows it's fragile,
God knows everything,
God knows it could snap apart right now
Just like putting scissors to a string.
</pre>

<pre class="bridge">
God knows it's terrifying,
God sees it all unfold,
There's a million reasons for you to be crying
You been so bold and so cold.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
God knows that when you see it,
God knows you've got to weep,
God knows the secrets of your heart,
He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.

God knows there's a river,
God knows how to make it flow,
God knows you ain't gonna be taking
Nothing with you when you go.

God knows there's a purpose,
God knows there's a chance,
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Of any circumstance.

God knows there's a heaven,
God knows it's out of sight,
God knows we can get all the way from here to there
Even if we've got to walk a million miles by candlelight.
</pre>

3110xx):</p>

<pre class="verse">
G                    C/g
 God knows you ain't pretty,
G               C/g
 God knows it's true.
G                      Eb
 God knows there ain't anybody
     C                       G
Ever gonna take the place of you.
