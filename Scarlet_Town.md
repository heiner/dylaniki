    Am
    In Scarlet Town, where I was born

    There's ivy leaf and silver thorn

    The streets have names that you can't pronounce
    G                 E
    Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce

    The music starts and the people sway
    Everybody says, "Are you going my way?"
    Uncle Tom still workin' for Uncle Bill
    Scarlet Town is under the hill.

    Scarlet Town in the month of May
    Sweet William Holme on his deathbed lay
    Mistress Mary by the side of the bed
    Kissin' his face and puttin' prayers on his head

    So brave, so true, so gentle is he
    I'll weep for him as he would weep for me
    Little Boy Blue come your blow horn
    In Scarlet Town, where I was born.

    Scarlet Town, in the hot noon hours,
    There's palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
    Beggars crouching at the gate
    Help comes, but it comes too late

    By marble slabs and in fields of stone
    You make your humble wishes known
    I touched the garment, but the hem was torn
    In Scarlet Town, where I was born.

    In Scarlet Town, the end is near
    The Seven Wonders of the World are here
    The evil and the good livin' side by side
    All human forms seem glorified

    Put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
    See who will hold you and kiss you good night
    There's walnut groves and maplewood
    In Scarlet Town cryin' won't do no good.

    In Scarlet Town, you fight your father's foes
    Up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
    You fight 'em on high and you fight 'em down in
    You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin

    You've got legs that can drive men mad
    A lot of things we didn't do that I wish we had
    In Scarlet Town, the sky is clear
    You'll wish to God that you stayed right here.

    Set 'em Joe, play "Walkin' the Floor"
    Play it for my flat-chested junkie whore
    I'm staying up late, I'm making amends
    While we smile, all heaven descends

    If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
    All things are beautiful in their time
    The black and the white, the yellow and the brown
    It's all right there in front of you in Scarlet Town.
