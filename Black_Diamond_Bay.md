“C/b” (or just /b when following a C) is shorthand for x20010 in the
descending bass figure:

    C   x<strong>3</strong>2010
    C/b x<strong>2</strong>0010
    Am  x<strong>0</strong>2210
    G   <strong>3</strong>20003

It is not obvious which chord ends the lines 7 and 9. I've chosen the
C/b, since it matches both the *b* of the vocal and the *c* of the
violin, but both a plain C, G or even D7 are playable.

    Em
    Up on the white veranda
    C                         G
    She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.
    Em
    Her passport shows a face
        C
    From another time and place
              G
    She looks nothin' like that.
    Bm                          C D    C
    And all the remnants of her recent past
    C/b G
    Are scattered in the wild wind.
        Bm
    She walks across the marble floor
            C     D        C        C/b
    Where a voice from the gambling room
       G
    is callin' her to come on in.
        Bm                      Am
    She smiles, walks the other way
           C    /b   Am    G       D(/f#)      C
    As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
         C     /b Am   G
    From Black Diamond Bay.

    As the mornin' light breaks open, the Greek comes down
    And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.
    "Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says,
    Carefully removes his fez,
    "Am I hearin' you right?"
    And as the yellow fog is liftin'
    The Greek is quickly headin' for the second floor.
    She passes him on the spiral staircase
    Thinkin' he's the Soviet Ambassador,
    She starts to speak, but he walks away
    As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
    On Black Diamond Bay.

    A soldier sits beneath the fan
    Doin' business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.
    Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.
    The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,
    "Can you see anything?"
    Then the Greek appears on the second floor
    In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,
    While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,
    Says, "Open up another deck."
    But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,”
    As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
    From Black Diamond Bay.

    The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
    As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.
    He tried to grab the woman's hand,
    Said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand."
    She said, "That ain't enough."
    Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
    While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.
    She passed the door that the Greek had locked,
    Where a handwritten sign read, "Do Not Disturb."
    She knocked upon it anyway
    As the sun went down and the music did play
    On Black Diamond Bay.

    "I've got to talk to someone quick!"
    But the Greek said, "Go away," and he kicked the chair to the floor.
    He hung there from the chandelier.
    She cried, "Help, there's danger near
    Please open up the door!"
    Then the volcano erupted
    And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.
    The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
    Thinking of forbidden love.
    But the desk clerk said, "It happens every day,"
    As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
    On Black Diamond Bay.

    As the island slowly sank
    The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
    The dealer said, "It's too late now.
    You can take your money, but I don't know how
    You'll spend it in the tomb."
    The tiny man bit the soldier's ear
    As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
    While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,
    "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
    She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
    As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
    From Black Diamond Bay.

    I was sittin' home alone one night in L.A.,
    Watchin' old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.
    It seems there was an earthquake that
    Left nothin' but a Panama hat
    And a pair of old Greek shoes.
    Didn't seem like much was happenin',
    So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.
    Seems like every time you turn around
    There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
    And there's really nothin' anyone can say
    And I never did plan to go anyway
    To Black Diamond Bay.
